Almost everyone you speak to, hear from, or watch that is successful in an endeavor says the same thing when asked how another can make their dream become a reality. Whether that dream is to become a famous singer, to invent the next world changing invention, to become a parent, or to be your own version of successful. The answer you are most likely to recieve is to start. Beginning the journey and understanding the task in which you are thinking of undertaking is not impossible is the single hardest thing to do when trying to achieve that which you want to achieve in life. For me coding has become that achievement and choosing to start was again not an easy task.

The journey usually begins with an idea. Coding for me was no different, when I was younger there was a website that was popular amount tweenagers for playing games, talking to friends, creating a store, and raising some pets. That website was called Neopets. Neopets was a flash player based website that had games, a world to explore, and an adventure that you could set on with your own goals. For many those goals aligned with amassing tons of "Neopoints" which was the currency of Neopia, the world in which Neopets existed. The way you gained these points was through various interactions with the website. However it seemed the two most popular would be, playing the games and opening a shop.

Opening a shop was simple, you clicked a button and then selected the items you had that you would like to place within the shop, and how much you would like to charge for them. However as I looked at more and more shops I noticed some had the simple layout the website created for you, while others had amazing dynamic links that llowed you to navigate them as if they were a full on online reatailer. This in turn peaked the child like curiosity of how this was possible. This again ws due to HTML, this is where the actually journey starts. I dove in head first creating a shop that would fulfill all of my customers needs. Neopets offered a simple basic HTML course that helped you get srated that can still be read today.

After this though I never chose to "start" I never made the decision to persue coding as anything more than my Neopets shop. Over time HTML and CSS would appear at different points in my life. The next notable example being MySpace, the faceboook before facebook. While I was an adolescent everyone had a MySpace and you could have custom templates which were built with noneother than HTML and CSS. However yet again I did'nt choose to "start" I made my page and moved forward never seeing coding as a career or anything more than a tool to make those MySpace views climb to the heavens.

Enter college (I know weve made a jump from adolescence to college, but trust me everyone wants to skip those years) I was set on becoming a lawyer. My teachers said I would make an excellent one I have an analytical mind, and a drive to make a difference. I started my path to law school as many do with comp, math, and some other general education courses. However along the way I watched my drive get lower and lower. This thing I was persuing, I wasn't persuing it for me. I was persuing it for everyone that said I'd be good at it. However I never asked myself "do I enjoy this"? The answer of course was I don't. I like to speak in public, but I like to create I like to problem solve. Things that law doesn't always lend itself to. 

The next thing I did would change my path, I enrolled in a Intro to Computer Programming course. Thinking it would be interesting since I enjoyed coding in the past. I wanted to take the course to simply take a breather and think about what I wanted to do next. Never would I think that this could be a potential career. However when my professor spoke about working for honeywell and programming satellites I could'nt believe that this world existed. There were no MySpace pages here it was actual amazing creation people shaping the future with code. Generating new ideas that helped us put people and objects into space. This lit the fire that is still burning this what enocuraged me to "start.

Soon after that course I began self learning and then decided that I did not want to persue more time in college I instead wanted to attend a boot camp. This led me to Flatiron which is where my journey has led me so far. The hardest part of any journey is always the first step. Even though so many things may be pushing us towards that first step we still will always be the ones who actually take it. It took me a long time to notice the pattern in my life that led to me actually "starting" my journey. I enocurage you to think about what you want, what you truly want out of your life. Then remind yourself that it's not impossible. Then the most important step of all start.
