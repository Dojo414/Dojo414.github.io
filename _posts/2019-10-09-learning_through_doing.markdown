This week I set forth to complete my first project here at Flatiron School. This project was a CLI application that scraped a website for information based on information from the user, and then output said information in a readable manner. I have to say when I first started reading the criteria about a month ago I imagined how could I ever create something like that? I most definitely thought that creating something with functional use was far off in my coding journey. However as I started the last bit of the Object Oriented Ruby section things started to fall in place.

I began to have those eureka moments as I imagined how this lesson or that lesson would apply to my project. Then it felt I had my tools in order to create this application. The hardest part of this for me was the CSS selectors. It is rather amazing how different websites can create such easy and such difficult HTML and CSS to read. The first website I looked through had selectors that mainly had style elements inside of their classes specifying what was done to the element. However there would be no class or id to say what kind of content was contained. Then the second website I looked through was the exact opposite. The selectors explicitly labeled what content would be contained inside of the elements contained within. I had a newfound appreciation for clean code!

After finding a clean website I was able to set out to scrape the information. After obtaining the information I started to see just how far I have come in this journey already. When I started I knew about loops and a couple other basic logics of programming, but now I was using those tools to do things that I never would've thought of. I was going in and felt comfortable with these tools and error messages that would make me sigh due to lack of knowledge of how to fix them now were easy to read and easy to fix.

The last of my revelations came through GitHub. I had learned a small amount of GitHub but fully understanding how the system worked wasn't within my grasp yet. However now after having to use it for this project I feel fully at ease when sending commits, cloning repos, renaming files, and much more. This project has taught me so much more than I thought it would, and I can happily say I definitely am starting to feel not like someone who knows what programming is, but someone that can understand programming, and build something of use with it.
